## Installation

### From Release (Recommended - Windows)

1.  Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/rhewrani/Finance-Manager/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest `Setup_Finance_Manager_vX.X.X.exe`.
3.  Run the downloaded executable and follow the installer instructions.

### Building From Source

#### Prerequisites

*   C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
*   CMake (version 3.16 or higher)
*   Qt 6.x (or Qt 5.x, though Qt 6 is recommended)

#### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rhewrani/Finance-Manager.git
    cd Finance-Manager
    ```
2.  Create a build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  Configure the project using CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
    *   **Note:** If CMake cannot find Qt automatically, you might get an error like `Could not find a package configuration file provided by "QT"`. In this case, you need to tell CMake where Qt is installed.
    *   **Solution:** Add the `-DQT_DIR` parameter to specify the path to Qt's CMake configuration files.

    **Example (Windows, Qt 6.x installed in `C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64`):**
    ```bash
    cmake .. -DQT_DIR="C:/Qt/6.9.1/msvc2022_64/lib/cmake/Qt6"
    ```
    *   **Important:**
        *   Replace `C:/Qt/6.9.1/msvc2022_64` with the actual path to your Qt installation.
        *   Ensure the path points to the directory containing `Qt6Config.cmake` (or `Qt5Config.cmake` for Qt 5).
        *   Use forward slashes (`/`) or double backslashes (`\\`) in the path.
4.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
    *(Or use your IDE/build system generated by CMake, e.g., `make`, `ninja`, open `Finance_Manager.sln` in Visual Studio)*
5.  Copy template files:
    After a successful build, manually copy the `data.json` and `settings.json` files from the `src/templates` directory in the source code to the directory where the compiled `Finance_Manager.exe` executable is located (typically `build/` or `build/Release/`). These files contain the initial structure and default settings needed by the application.

The executable (`Finance_Manager.exe`) will be located in the build directory or a subdirectory like `src`.

## Usage

1.  Launch the application (`Finance_Manager.exe`).
2.  Use the interface to add income or expense entries.
3.  Navigate between views to see your data.
4.  Adjust settings via the settings menu as needed.

## Technologies Used

*   **C++:** Core programming language.
*   **Qt Framework:** For the graphical user interface and application logic.
*   **CMake:** Build system.
*   **JSON:** Data storage format.
